# Dollar Exchange Rate Analysis 📊

This is a **learning-focused data project** centered on the analysis of dollar exchange rates.  
It covers the full workflow from raw data to insights, combining data cleaning, analysis, SQL querying, and dashboarding.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice and integrate core data skills by:
- Cleaning and preparing exchange rate data  
- Analyzing returns, volatility, and temporal patterns (e.g. day-of-week effects)  
- Writing SQL queries for aggregation and analysis  
- Presenting results in an interactive dashboard  

This project is intended as **hands-on training** and portfolio practice.

## Data Source

The exchange rate data originates from the **Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) of Uruguay**, which publishes historical exchange rate series for major currencies, including the US dollar.
